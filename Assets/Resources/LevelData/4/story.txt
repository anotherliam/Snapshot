A steady drizzle sets in and I pull my jacket closed. The world is hushed, enveloped in mist. I am no longer sure how far we have walked or where, exactly, we are. It feels as if we've wandered right off the edge of the map. Mist veils the distant mountains making them into mere shadows, ghosts. Strange to think that just yesterday we were there, near that mountain's peak, waking up and breakfasting at the chalet. Now we are surrounded by the dripping mass of the forest. Vines loop across our path, and a clearing opens ahead. We step into air and light as if we are crossing the boundary to another world. You run ahead across the rain-wet grass and I follow, gasping for breath. Our laughter echoes in the quiet. Old stone bounces it back; a building rises like a dream before us. Soaring stone walls, clad in moss, suggest the magic and grandeur of another age. You turn to me, your face alight with wonder. Who lived here? When? I round the corner to see the wall broken, the stones spilled like blood in the grass.
