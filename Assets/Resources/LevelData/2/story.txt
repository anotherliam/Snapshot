No offence to camels, but if I never set butt on one again it'll be too soon. Over the past three days I've learnt, in vivid detail, what 'saddlesore' means. There's a persistent nip in the small of my back and an ache in my thighs, and other unmentionable places. And camels, well, stink. A trek across the desert sounds romantic doesn't it? I thought so too. See the Outback, the 'Real Australia'. I guess I thought I was Hugh Jackman. Pictured myself tanned and muscled, astride a noble beast. I didn't think about sand in every nook and cranny. Sunburn peeling on my nose. Million-watt sunlight and space that goes on and on. The landscape out here is immense, but it's the sky that'll knock you out. At night, a field of stars, ice-cold. At day, a blue so deep and clear it'll make you dizzy to look at it. It could be miles away, untouchable, or pressed right against your eyes. You lose the ability to judge distance. Like the oasis there. How far is it? Wait, is that a pub? I can already taste that cold, cold beer.
