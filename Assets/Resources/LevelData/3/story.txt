As you emerge from the station into the afternoon's sticky warmth, the northbound train with its cargo of commuters rattles noisily away across the bridge. You're lucky to live so near the city. You can even see your office tower. But as you walk along the river's north bank, with its bright busy bars alive with the after-work crowd, the distance home still seems vast. Over the river the south bank lies quiet and dark, and you're weary enough to just sink down in the soft grass and fall asleep under the trees. Away from the din of the bars there is only the soft lapping of the water. Under the lengthening shadows its usual murk is disguised and it looks beautiful, alight with the glow of the setting sun. Your step quickens towards home, towards rest, towards her. The deli on the corner will still be open and the wine shop next door. She'll arrive home just as the last rays of sunset fade from the sky, just as tired as you. But you'll be waiting to light up her night. It's a race, now, between you and the sun.
